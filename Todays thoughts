I started reading latest book of my favourate auther "Robert Green" which is "The law of Human Nature".
I learnt that people are narssistic and love themselfs, icluding me. I am not perfect am not the good persont I like to think I am.
Even I have some bad qualities, I must search harder within myslelf to find my bad characteristic traits no matter how difficult and 
painfull it may feel to dicouver faults in myself. But this is the better way to rise even higher and be more humber, down to earth. 

Today I found one bad quality in myself. I realised that when I am in hurry or when time very less I loos my poise and composure
and might hurt someone in that process which will later haunt me and make me feel bad.

But now since I konow my weakness, I can take action and next time when i am in hurry I can conciously stop myself and think about my
actions, which will save me pain and future remorse. 


wow did I just created a branch!!!!!
