I started reading latest book of my favourate auther "Robert Green" which is "The law of Human Nature".
I learnt that people are narssistic and love themselfs, icluding me. I am not perfect am not the good persont I like to think I am.
Even I have some bad qualities, I must search harder within myslelf to find my bad characteristic traits no matter how difficult and 
painfull it may feel to dicouver faults in myself. But this is the better way to rise even higher and be more humber, down to earth. 

Today I found one bad quality in myself. I realised that when I am in hurry or when time very less I loos my poise and composure
and might hurt someone in that process which will later haunt me and make me feel bad.

But now since I konow my weakness, I can take action and next time when i am in hurry I can conciously stop myself and think about my
actions, which will save me pain and future remorse. 


Hehehe:
I am excited to see how github will merge my master and branch file as this is my 6th commit, and have to see on which line github will 
add this line

This time trying to mess with continuity and will see how blame will represent this commit. As this is my 3rd commit but am writing this in 2nd place


wow did I just created a branch!!,, not so much excited yet bro, will see how my 4th commit will showup in blame hehehehe!!!


so on commiting on previous commit will actually edit it and it will not show in blame. But still have to explore git and see
if its seen in other places
